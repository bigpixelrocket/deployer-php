          Review the current PR diff and meticulously catalog all the changes in this branch.

          Report back on where the changes fall short of our development, architecture and testing rules.

          Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on suggested changes and a brief summary at the end.

          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ‚úÖ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

          Commenting rules:
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: üö® Critical üîí Security ‚ö° Performance ‚ö†Ô∏è Logic ‚úÖ Resolved ‚ú® Improvement

          Submission:
          - Use only: gh pr review --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes
          - Submit one review containing inline comments plus a concise summary"
