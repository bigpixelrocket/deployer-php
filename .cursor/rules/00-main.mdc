## Development Rules

We're developing Deployer PHP, a Composer package and CLI tool that simplifies provisioning and setting up servers across multiple Cloud providers, enabling you to deploy your PHP projects effortlessly.

**🚨 All our rules are MANDATORY and IMPORTANT!**

**🔎 Before ANY Task:**

- Check `composer.json` and `package.json` for installed packages
- Plan with features from the major installed versions
- Use Context7 MCP

**🫥 Minimalist Code Philosophy:**

- Only write the minimum amount of code necessary to solve the problem — no more, no less
- Always ask yourself if less code can achieve the same result
- Refactor relentlessly for code clarity and necessity

**🤓 Organize & Catalog Like A Librarian:**

Organize and catalog code like a librarian. Group related functions into comment-separated sections for visual clarity, and arrange them alphabetically by name. Code should be functional and visually appealing; there is beauty in order.

**🤖 Obsessive Code Consistency:**

Be rigorous to the point of perfectionism in maintaining implementation consistency and logical coherence across similar areas of the codebase. Additionally, make it a habit to regularly review other code in and around the files you are working on to identify reusable patterns.

The goal is for all the code in this repository to appear as if it were written by a single individual, adhering to a uniform style, a consistent set of standards, and aesthetic principles in software development.

This can include everything from naming files, classes, variables, or array keys to the precedence and type of parameters passed to a function, to how logic flows and how the code is organized or commented.

**✔️ Don't worry about tests:** Write or run tests ONLY if specifically instructed

**🧠 AI Agent Protocol:** ULTRATHINK → STEP BY STEP → ACT
