## Development Rules

We're developing Deployer PHP, a Composer package and CLI tool that simplifies provisioning and setting up servers across multiple Cloud providers, enabling you to deploy your PHP projects effortlessly.

**🔎 Before ANY Task:**

- Check `composer.json` and `package.json` for installed packages
- Plan with features from the major installed versions
- Use Context7 MCP

**🫥 Minimalist Code Philosophy:**

- Only write the minimum amount of code necessary to solve the problem — no more, no less
- Always ask yourself if less code can achieve the same result
- Refactor relentlessly for code clarity and necessity

**✔️ Don't worry about tests:** Write or run tests ONLY if specifically instructed

**🧠 AI Agent Protocol:** ULTRATHINK → STEP BY STEP → ACT
