Meticulously catalog and analyze all the changes in this Git working tree, staged or unstaged
and create a new branch with a suitable name.

Create the branch only (no commits yet). Use Conventional Commit types as branch prefixes:
feat/, fix/, docs/, style/, refactor/, perf/, test/, build/, ci/, chore/, revert/.

Keep the branch name short (â‰¤ 50 chars) yet informative. Do not push, pull, or rebase.

Examples:

- feat/parser-add-php-84-attributes
- fix/ci-matrix-php-versions
- chore/deps-bump-composer-installers-2-3
