Analyze the changes in this Git working tree and create one or more commits with suitable titles.

Use Conventional Commits to group related changes into cohesive commits (commits should be independently meaningful).

Keep titles short (â‰¤ 72 chars), imperative, no trailing period. Do not push, pull, or rebase.

Examples:

- feat(parser): add support for PHP 8.4 attributes
- fix(ci): correct matrix PHP versions in build workflow
- chore(deps): bump composer/installers to ^2.3

Body (optional): explain motivation, context, and breaking changes (use BREAKING CHANGE:).
